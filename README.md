## Introduction

The AI-Enhanced Balanced Tree (AEBT) is designed to efficiently manage data using a balanced tree structure while leveraging AI algorithms for advanced functionalities such as intelligent search and adaptive sorting. By integrating AI, AEBT optimizes data operations, predicts patterns, and provides insightful analysis.

## Features

- **⚖️ Balanced Structure:** Utilizes AVL or Red-Black tree properties for efficient data operations.
- **🧠 AI-Driven Optimization:** Incorporates AI algorithms to optimize search, insertion, deletion, and sorting operations dynamically.
- **🔍 Intelligent Search:** Learns from past search patterns and predicts relevant elements.
- **🔄 Adaptive Sorting:** Employs adaptive sorting algorithms based on data characteristics.
- **📊 Performance Monitoring:** Tracks data access patterns and execution times, using AI to adjust the tree structure for optimal performance.

## Project Objectives

1. Develop an efficient, AI-integrated balanced tree.
2. Enhance sorting and search capabilities using AI.
3. Optimize memory usage while maintaining high performance.
4. Ensure scalability for large datasets.
5. Provide a user-friendly interface.
6. Validate and benchmark performance.
7. Demonstrate real-world use cases.
8. Document and share findings.
9. Encourage further research and development.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AEBT.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd AEBT
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the script:
    ```sh
    python aebt.py
    ```
2. Follow the menu prompts to perform data operations:
    - Insert data into the balanced tree.
    - Sort data using AI-enhanced sorting.
    - Search for elements using AI predictions.

## Performance Evaluation

The AEBT tracks the time taken for sorting and searching operations. You can visualize the performance data using the plotting menu:

1. Choose an option to plot sorting, searching, or both data.
2. View the plotted graphs showing the time complexity for different dataset sizes.
